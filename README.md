# bobaclient

**This program is unfinished and not ready for use.**

Official client for bobashare

## Layout

- `include/` is for headers
- `src/` is for source files
- inside each there is a `bobaclient/` directory: it contains libbobaclient files
  - the files outside of the `bobaclient/` directory are for the CLI application
